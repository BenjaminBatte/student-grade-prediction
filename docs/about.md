# ℹ️ About This Project

The **Student Grade Prediction** project was developed as part of the _ITS-836: Data Science & Big Data Analytics_ course at the University of the Cumberlands.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Apply **machine learning techniques** to predict students’ final grades.
- Identify the **most influential factors** affecting performance.
- Demonstrate a complete **data science workflow**: data wrangling, EDA, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## 📊 Motivation

- Educational institutions need tools to **detect at-risk students early**.
- By predicting performance, schools can **intervene proactively** to improve outcomes, reduce dropout rates, and allocate resources more effectively.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib
- **Workflow:** Modular source code (`src/`), reproducible pipelines, and CLI tools
- **Outputs:** Metrics, models, logs, and visualizations stored in the `results/` directory
