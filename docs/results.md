## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Two models were applied to both datasets: **Linear Regression (LR)** and **Random Forest Regression (RF)**. The performance was evaluated using R², RMSE, and MAE.

### Mathematics Dataset

| Model             | R²    | RMSE | MAE  |
| ----------------- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
| Linear Regression | 0.724 | 2.38 | 1.65 |
| Random Forest     | 0.813 | 1.96 | 1.18 |

**Interpretation:** Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression, reducing prediction error by ~0.4–0.5 grade points and explaining ~8% more variance. The RF model typically predicts within **2 grade points** on a 0–20 scale.

### Portuguese Dataset

| Model             | R²    | RMSE | MAE  |
| ----------------- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
| Linear Regression | 0.849 | 1.22 | 0.77 |
| Random Forest     | 0.842 | 1.24 | 0.75 |

**Interpretation:** Both models performed strongly, with predictions accurate within **~1 grade point**. Interestingly, Linear Regression slightly outperformed Random Forest in this dataset, likely due to the stronger linear relationships among variables.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Absences (Math):** Most students had few absences, but a small group showed extreme absenteeism, disproportionately affecting their performance.
- **Final Grades (Portuguese):** Distribution was approximately normal (10–12 out of 20), with a subset of students failing entirely (G3 = 0).
- **Correlation Analysis:** Strongest predictors of final grade (G3) were **first (G1) and second period grades (G2)**, while demographic and lifestyle factors showed weak correlations.

## 📝 Discussion

- **Hypothesis Confirmed:** G1 and G2 consistently emerged as the strongest predictors of G3.
- **Model Comparison:** Random Forest excelled on the Math dataset, while both models achieved near parity on Portuguese.
- **Socio-Behavioral Factors:** Variables like alcohol use, family relations, and parental education added little predictive value.
- **Intervention Insights:** Schools could use these models to identify at-risk students early (low G1/G2 scores or extreme absenteeism) and intervene with tutoring or support services.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

- **Random Forest > Linear Regression** for Math.
- **Linear Regression ≈ Random Forest** for Portuguese.
- Both models predict final grades within 1–2 points of accuracy.
- Practical application: supports **early academic intervention** and **data-driven decision-making** in education.
